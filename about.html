                    <p>I'm a certified open water scuba diver. I have dived in Puerto Rico and in Belize. In the summer of 2022 I had the opportuinty to take 
                       this newly found interest behind the camera in Belize. My team and I worked on a film revolving around 
                       coral reef conservation at one of the worlds biggest reefs. I spent a whole week spear fishing lion fish, an invasive species, and helping capture
                       underwater shots and interviews to help raise awareness about the importance of coral reef conservation.
