                    <p>I'm a certified open water scuba diver. I have dived in Puerto Rico and in Belize. In the summer of 2022 I had the opportuinty to take 
                       this newly found interest behind the camera in Belize. My team and I worked on a film revolving around 
                       coral reef conservation at one of the worlds biggest reefs. I spent a whole week spear fishing lion fish, an invasive species, and helping capture
                       underwater shots and interviews to help raise awareness about the importance of coral reef conservation.

                    <p> When not programming, I enjoy indulging in the arts whether it be pencil on paper or digital art. 
                      I love drawing landscapes/citscapes of countries that I visit. I also enjoy creating digital art 
                      using photoshop, illustrator and procreate. I've done graphic deisgn for documentaries, products, apps, and events.
                      I of course also enjoy creating art using code such as Shader and ThreeJs. Art is a great way for me to excape coding.

                  <div class="description-box">
                    <p>I've been disc-jockeying since I was 14 years old. My father is a DJ so I started off really early by 
                      helping out my dad setup his stage and equipment. I eventually started playing my own mixes and tracks
                      on set. I fell in love with controlling the ambiance of the room. Ever since then I always try to find ways to improve
                      my performance. Recently, I incorporated cool visuals I created with Shader code onto the display screens that I use when
                      performing.
